# Capstone Project - 1 

This is my Capstone Project 1, which covers a couple of DevOps tools and their integration with Jenkins, known as an automation server. In this project, I configured my Jenkins Master and Jenkins Slave using Ansible. I cloned a repository from GitHub and created my own branches. After installing Jenkins, I connected the nodes with the Jenkins Master to establish communication between them, allowing specific jobs to run on specific nodes. For example, a push to the develop branch will test the code on the test-server node, and a push to the master branch will test the code and deploy it to the prod-server node to serve end users.
